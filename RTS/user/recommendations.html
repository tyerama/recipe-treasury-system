Melt 2 Tbsp. butter in a large high-sided skillet over medium-high heat. Add leeks and half of lemon zest, season with salt and pepper, and mix to coat leeks in butter. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks are somewhat tender, about 5 minutes. Remove lid, increase heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and just starting to take on color, about 3 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring often, 3 minutes, then add broth, scraping up any browned bits. Tuck short sides of each chicken thigh underneath so they are touching and nestle seam side down into rice mixture. Bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until rice is tender and chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Cut remaining 1 Tbsp. butter into small pieces and scatter over mixture. Re-cover and let sit 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, pulse anchovy, garlic, capers, a few pinches of red pepper flakes, and remaining lemon zest in a food processor until finely chopped. Add herbs; process until a paste forms. With motor running, gradually stream in oil until loosened to a thick sauce. Add half of lemon juice; season salsa verde with salt.
Drizzle remaining lemon juice over chicken and rice. Serve with salsa verde.</p><img src="RTS/user/Food_Images/Food_Images/chicken-and-rice-with-leeks-and-salsa-verde.jpg" width="200"><br><br><h2>Chicken and Potato Gratin With Brown Butter Cream</h2><p>Season chicken all over with 4 tsp. salt. Place in an airtight container and cover. Chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 425?F. Toss potatoes, shallots, and 2 tsp. salt in a large bowl.
Melt 4 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring often, until butter foams, then browns, 5?8 minutes. Immediately remove from heat (it will continue to darken) and stir in cream, garlic, pepper, nutmeg, and remaining 1? tsp. salt. Set saucepan over medium-low heat and cook, stirring, until salt is dissolved and mixture is warm to the touch. Stir in thyme and sage; remove from heat.
Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. butter in a large stainless-steel skillet over medium-high until melted and bubbling. Working in 2 batches, cook chicken, skin side down, until golden underneath, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a 13x9" or 3-qt. baking dish and arrange skin side up. Set skillet with pan drippings aside. Nestle potatoes and shallots around chicken (don?t place on top). Pour brown butter cream over chicken and vegetables, making sure herbs and spices are evenly dispersed and tucking herbs into vegetables so they don?t get too crispy when they bake.
Bake gratin until cream is mostly reduced and chicken and vegetables are dark golden brown, about 40 minutes. Let gratin cool 5?10 minutes.
Meanwhile, pulse bread in a food processor until pieces are about oat-size (you should have about 1? cups). Toss breadcrumbs in pan drippings in reserved skillet to coat. Cook over medium heat, scraping up browned bits with a spatula, until deep golden brown, 5?7 minutes. Let cool.
To serve, top gratin with breadcrumbs. Serve lemon wedges alongside for squeezing over if desired.</p><img src="RTS/user/Food_Images/Food_Images/chicken-and-potato-gratin-brown-butter-cream.jpg" width="200"><br><br><h2>Drunk Apricot Shito (Ghanaian Hot Pepper Sauce)</h2><p>Place apricots in a small bowl and pour in hot water to cover. Let sit 20 minutes, then drain and coarsely chop. Return apricots to same bowl and add rum; stir to coat. Chill at least 30 minutes and up to 1 day. Drain into a mesh sieve set over another small bowl or container. Reserve apricots and rum separately.
Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add cinnamon, 3 Tbsp. coconut sugar, and reserved apricots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until apricots are slightly softened and coated in caramel, 6?8 minutes. Add reserved rum and cook, stirring often, until thickened and syrupy, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly. (Just FYI: You can eat these drunk apricots right away over vanilla ice cream and be very happy.)
Toast grains of selim pods and cubeb peppers in a small skillet over medium-low heat, shaking occasionally, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle and let cool. Grind as well as you can. The grains of selim won?t completely break up, so cracked open but mostly whole is okay?you just want to release some of their flavor.
Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Cook white and red onions, stirring occasionally, until softened and just starting brown, 20?25 minutes. Stir in ground grains of selim and cubeb pepper, garlic, ginger, and remaining 1 tsp. coconut sugar. Cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Add red pepper flakes, rosemary, thyme, prawn powder, and 1 tsp. salt to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add drunk apricots along with any syrup and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes.
Add tomato pur?e to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes, then stir in chile powder. Add broth and fresh chile. Cover pot and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until a loose dark brown paste forms, 30?40 minutes. The oil will rise to the surface when the sauce is ready. Remove from heat; taste and season with more salt if needed. If you like texture, leave as is, or blend with an immersion blender (or let it cool slightly and blend it in a blender) to make it smooth. Let cool completely.
Spoon shito into jars or an airtight container with at least a ?" layer of oil on top.
Do ahead: Shito can made 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.
Note: The amount of chile described in this recipe is what I would classify as pretty hot?some West Africans might call this medium hot, some very hot. Folks familiar with heat will enjoy this, but if you don?t like super-jacked heat you should probably err on the lower end of the range.

Arrange, skin side down, in a cold, dry medium Dutch oven and set over medium heat. Cook, undisturbed, until skin is golden brown and crisp and easily releases from pot, 8?10 minutes. Slide thighs around to different spots (this will ensure even browning) and continue to cook until deeply browned, 3?5 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to a plate. Let pot cool 2 minutes.
Set pot over medium-low heat; add shallots, garlic, and ginger and cook, stirring constantly, until very fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in rice and star anise and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Stir in soy sauce, ? tsp. salt, and 3 cups water. Nestle chicken back into rice mixture in pot, arranging skin side up. Increase heat to medium and bring liquid to a simmer. Immediately cover pot, reduce heat to low, and cook 25 minutes. Remove from heat and let chicken and rice sit 10 minutes.
While the chicken and rice are cooking, make the sauce. Whisk peanut butter, soy sauce, vinegar, Sriracha, ginger, honey, and ? cup warm water in a small bowl until smooth and pourable. If sauce still looks a little thick, continuing adding water until it reaches a drizzle-able consistency.
Remove lid from pot and fluff rice with a fork. Pluck out and discard star anise. Serve chicken and rice with peanut sauce, cucumber, and cilantro alongside.
Do Ahead: Sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill.</p><img src="RTS/user/Food_Images/Food_Images/one-pot-gingery-chicken-and-rice-with-peanut-sauce.jpg" width="200"><br><br><h2>Tangy Vinegar Chicken With Barberries and Orange</h2><p>Preheat oven to 350?F. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then season all over with salt. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook chicken, skin side down, until golden brown underneath, 7?10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate, leaving any fat in the pan.
Remove pan from heat and let fat cool down a little (about 3 minutes should do it). Return pan to medium heat and add onion and garlic. Cook, stirring often and adding a splash of water if needed to keep onion from getting too dark, until onion is softened and golden brown, 6?8 minutes. Stir in barberries, turmeric, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in vinegar and 1 cup water, season lightly with salt, and bring to a simmer.
Arrange chicken, skin side up, in sauce, then nestle orange halves, cut side down, around chicken. Transfer skillet to oven and bake, uncovered, until sauce is reduced and chicken is cooked through, 30?35 minutes (or 20?25 minutes for separated things and drumsticks).
Transfer chicken to a platter. Spoon sauce over, then squeeze juice from orange halves on top.</p><img src="RTS/user/Food_Images/Food_Images/tangy-vinegar-chicken-with-barberries-and-orange.jpg" width="200"><br><br></body></html>
